# Attempted Docker

This directory contains files that used to be at the top-level of the project.

At the time of creating this project, the USB support for Devcontainers on MacOS is not mature enough.

Once USB support appears to be functional on MacOS, using a devcontainer may be possible.


# Future Ideas

1. I have a parallels license already
    * It should be possible to run the Docker executor inside of the parallels machine
    * That machine can have the USB passed through (Parallels already supports USB access from the VM)

1. Running `colima`
    * This is a VM/container open-source application
    * It does not seem to have a mature USB pass-through at this point either
